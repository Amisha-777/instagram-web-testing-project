# Instagram Web Testing Project

## üìå Project Overview

This repository contains the complete test plan, automation scripts, defect logs, and final report for the **Instagram Web Testing Project**, conducted as part of a software testing course project.

The objective of this project was to evaluate the stability, correctness, and usability of the Instagram web application. A combination of manual and automated testing strategies was used to validate four key functional modules:

- Login
- Profile Management
- Content Creation and Sharing
- User Search

## üîß Tools and Technologies

- **Selenium WebDriver** ‚Äì Automation Testing
- **Python** ‚Äì Scripting Language
- **Jupyter Notebook** ‚Äì Automation Script Execution
- **Excel/Google Sheets** ‚Äì Test Case and Defect Management
- **WebDriver Manager** ‚Äì Browser Driver Handling
- **Browser** ‚Äì Google Chrome / Microsoft Edge

## ‚úÖ Summary of Testing Efforts

- **Total Test Cases:** 19  
- **Pass Rate:** 94.7%  
- **Defects Found:** 3 (2 High Severity, 1 Medium)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Automation Challenges

- Use of **Dynamic XPaths** due to frequently changing class attributes
- Fallback to **ID-based locators** when possible
- Use of **Explicit Waits** and **Reusable Functions** to handle dynamic elements

## Way Forward
- Expand test scope to include additional features (e.g., messaging, notifications)
- Develop complete user journey automation flows
- Perform cross-browser testing for broader compatibility
